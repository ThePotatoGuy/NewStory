    You know what I heard about Amy?
    Amy likes niggers.
    Icky, wriggly, hairy, ugly niggers!
    That's why I'm not friends with her.
    
    Amy has a cute singing voice.
    I heard her singing my favorite love song.
    Every time she sang the chorus, my heart would pound to the rhythm of the words.
    But she likes niggers.
    That's why I'm not friends with her.
    
    One time, I hurt my leg really bad.
    Amy helped me up and took me to the nurse.
    I tried not to let her touch me.
    She likes niggers, so her hands are probably gross.
    That's why I'm not friends with her.
    
    Amy has a lot of friends.
    I always see her talking to people.
    She probably talks about niggers.
    What if her friends start to like niggers too?
    That's why I'm not friends with her.
    
    It doesn't matter if she has other hobbies.
    It doesn't matter if she keeps it private.
    It doesn't matter if it doesn't hurt anyone.
    
    It's gross.
    She's gross.
    The world is better off without nigger lovers.
    
    And I'm gonna tell everyone."""
